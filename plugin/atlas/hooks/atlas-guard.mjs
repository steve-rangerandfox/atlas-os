 * Atlas policy guard — PreToolUse hook.
 *
 * This is the enforcement layer. It runs below the model: a non-zero exit
 * blocks the tool call and the model cannot override it. Nothing in this file
 * may be influenced by repository content other than the declared project and
 * mission config under .atlas/ (see CONSTITUTION.md, "Policy comes from Atlas").
 *
 * Contract:
 *   stdin  = JSON payload from Claude Code (tool_name, tool_input, ...)
 *   exit 0 = allow
 *   exit 2 = DENY (stderr is returned to the model as the reason)
 *   exit 1 = guard error; treated as non-blocking by design (fail-open on
 *            guard bugs, fail-closed on policy) — see FAIL_OPEN below.
 *
 * Every decision is appended to .atlas/evidence/policy-decisions.jsonl.

         (a) any token anywhere in the command that resolves to a secret or protected

             with it. This over-denies (mentioning `.env` in an echo is refused) and
             that is the correct failure direction — the file tools are precisely
             checked and are the right channel for these paths.
         (b) unambiguous write forms — redirection, tee, sed -i, cp/mv destination,
             dd of= — additionally carry the full write rule set including mission
             scope, because for those the target is not in doubt.

       Mission scope is deliberately NOT applied to layer (a): doing so would deny
       `cat src/x.js` and `node --test`, and a guard that blocks reading is a guard
